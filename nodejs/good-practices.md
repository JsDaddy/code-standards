- structure your project by components
- use secure configuration with environment variables
- properly separate dependencies between 'dependencies' and 'devDependencies' in package.json
- use swagger for design and document your APIs at scale
- use docker for DB containers and other parts of your application so other users don't have problems running the application
- use typeorm for working with DB 
- use migrations when you working with DB because it unsafe to use synchronize: true for schema synchronization on production once you get data in your database
- use class-validator for validation
- use class-transformer to tranfsorm plain object to some instance plain class and versa. Also it allows to serialize/deserialize object based on criteria.
- stick to the principles of DRY and KISS
- use unit tests for critical logic
